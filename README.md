# üêç Python Foundations & Practice

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-blue)

This repository serves as a comprehensive log of my journey in mastering the fundamentals of the Python programming language. Before diving into specialized libraries like NumPy or OpenCV, I believe in building a strong and deep foundation.

The scripts, notebooks, and exercises contained here represent my hands-on practice with the core syntax, data structures, and programming logic that form the bedrock of all advanced Python development.

## üìö My Learning Pathway

This repository covers the essential first step. My learning journey continues in my other practice repositories, which build directly upon the skills demonstrated here:

-   ‚û°Ô∏è **Step 1: Python Foundations (You are here)**
-   **Step 2:** Data Analysis with `Pandas` & `NumPy`
-   **Step 3:** Data Visualization with `Matplotlib`
-   **Step 4:** Computer Vision with `OpenCV`
